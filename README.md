One of the most important tasks to be addressed in intelligent farms is the crop monitoring. Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms are typically combined to analyze and classify images acquired by autonomous robots that monitor the growth of crops, and in particular, to discriminate crops (i.e. the good plants) from weeds (any undesirable or unwanted plant growing wild, especially those that takes food or nourishment from crops). Crop/weed discrimination of often tacked as an image-classification problem.
